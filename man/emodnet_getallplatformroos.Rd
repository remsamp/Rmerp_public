\usage{
emodnet_getallplatformroos(roosid)
}
\arguments{
\item{roosid}{is a character variable "1" to "6". 
BOOS is Baltic, NOOS is north West European Shelves ("3"), IBI is Irland Biscay Iberia, MOON mediterranean}
}
\description{
This function uploads EMODnet metadata about the location of stations
as well as the physics parameters that have been monitored at these stations. It 
differs from getallplatform because it filters information by ecoregions or ROOS
i.e. Regional Operational Oceanographic System
