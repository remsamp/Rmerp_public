\title{Function to grid and plot geolocated observations on a map}
\usage{
grid_data(mydata, myresolution, myzoom)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{is an R data.frame. It contains two columns that must be named lat and lon, lon corresponding to each observations.
mydata must have the right column names for the function to work. See example on how to do that.}

\item{myresolution}{is the size of the cells the data is to be aggregated over}

\item{myzoom}{is the zoom to be applied to plot the gridded data on ggmap map}
}
\value{
\code{grid_data} returns a data frame containing the number of observations per cell.
}
\description{
Data portals such as OBIS typically return tables of geolocated observations upon requests.
Gridded data is often used to represent in a synthetic way this type of observations,
but although R packages ggplot2 and ggmap are good at representing it,
there is no built-in function to go from raw to aggregated data.
}
\examples{
library(robis)
obs <- occurrence("Gadus morhua", year = 2002)
myobs <- data.frame(obs$decimalLongitude, obs$decimalLatitude)
names(myobs) <- c("lon", "lat")
justchecking <- grid_data(myobs, myresolution = 0.5, myzoom = 4)
# examine the data
head(justchecking$gridded_data)
# plot the data
justchecking$myplot
}
